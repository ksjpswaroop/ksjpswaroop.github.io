    "##Section 1: Problems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "###Unexpected Tags\n",
    "`mapparser.py` was used to count occurrences of each tag, with a result:\n",
    "- `bounds: 1`\n",
    "- `member: 12602`\n",
    "- `nd: 891530`\n",
    "- `node: 771167`\n",
    "- `osm: 1`\n",
    "- `relation: 1241`\n",
    "- `tag: 532159`\n",
    "- `way: 79357`\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional functionality was added to `mapparser.py` to examine the keys stored in each `tag` element, in the `k` attribute.  Unexpectedly, the 20 most common key values were:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{'amenity': 7006, 'building': 12487, 'created_by': 8353, 'highway': 67137, 'name': 41954, 'odbl': 10223, 'oneway': 9506, 'ref': 3695, 'service': 5894, 'tiger:cfcc': 35037, 'tiger:county': 35058, 'tiger:name_base': 28536, 'tiger:name_type': 26254, 'tiger:reviewed': 32442, 'tiger:separated': 24167, 'tiger:source': 26710, 'tiger:tlid': 26725, 'tiger:upload_uuid': 7913, 'tiger:zip_left': 21001, 'tiger:zip_right': 19591}`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `tags.py`, I parsed through the tag data and sampled a maximum of 20 values for each key.  Results were exported to `austin.osm-tag-data.json`.  This gave insight on some inconsistent data formats (e.g. `25 mph` vs `25`), incorrect mappings (e.g. `78722` under `state`), and some minor misspellings (e.g. `construction`).\n",
    "\n",
    "###Extra Encoded Data and Systems\n",
    "By examining what `tag` keys were present in the first 10 million lines, it was clear that at least two separate subsystems were encoded via `tag` elements: [Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system (TIGER)]( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER) data and [USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/USGS_GNIS) data.  Due to both redundancy and significant information lacking in GNIS data, I chose to remit it from population into the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Specialized Tag Elements\n",
    "At least 360 `tag` keys appeared only once. Many were extremely specialized, e.g. `recycling:glass_bottles` and several of these tags were name translations.  As part of the cleaning process, I manually selected a list of `tag` keys to filter out prior to database population.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Multiple Zip Codes\n",
    "Zip codes were presented in the data under various permutations of `tiger:zip_left` and `tiger:zip_right`, defined as semicolon delimited lists or colon delimited ranges.  Given that zip codes are a common search criteria, I thought that it would be a good idea to collect and serialize all zipcodes from all sources into a single array, and populate this into the base of the node under `zipcodes`.\n",
    "Phone Number Inconsistency\n",
    "Phone numbers were formatted inconsistently. I used the Python module `phonenumbers` to parse all phone numbers and re-format them to the standard `(123) 456-7890`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Abbreviated Street Names\n",
    "There were inconsistencies with street name abbreviations. For consistency, I translated all abbreviations into the ‘titleized’ long forms, e.g. `EXPWY` to `Expressway`.  Additionally, all `.` characters were removed.  Standard street name suffixes were imported and parsed from a CSV of U.S. Street Suffixes and Abbreviations (see References).  Additional misspellings and special cases (e.g. `I 35`, `IH-35`, `IH 35` to `Interstate Highway 35`) were added to the translation table in `suffix.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Relation and Member Elements\n",
    "There was the additional presence of `relation` and `member` tags. According to the [OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation), the `relation` tags are used to define logical or geographical groups.  For the purposes of populating a document database of `node` and `way` tags, I concluded that the best option was to parse these tags out.\n",

    "##Section 3: Conclusion\n",
    "###Additional Ideas\n",
    "    1) The report would not count to even 1% of what can be done with the Data Set. The Data Set need to be compressed by removing any `way` tags and waypoint-like nodes which could reduce the database size by factors.\n",
    "    2) With the queries conducted, there was more of a focus on the study of node ‘places’ rather than ways and their respective node ‘waypoints’.  Given that an overwhelming number of nodes (90.5%) do not include addresses and the large number (891530) of `nd` reference tags. \n",
    "    3) It would still be possible to remove any ‘orphaned’ nodes that were only referenced in the removed `relation` and `member` tags.\n",
    "    4) There are still several opportunities for cleaning and validation that I left unexplored.  Of note, the data set is populated only from one source: OpenStreetMaps.  While this crowdsourced repository pulls from multiple sources, some of data is potentially outdated.  According to the [OSM Tiger Wiki]( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TIGER), the most recent data pulled was from 2005.  It would have been an interesting exercise to validate and/or pull missing information (i.e. names) from the Google Maps API, since every node has latitude-longitude coordinates."
